                          <li> I am a policy analyst, data analyst and health economist with over 5 years of professional experience. I hold three Microsoft certifications and an AWS certification.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li> Previously, I served in the public insurance sector at Malaysia's Social Security Organisation. I was responsible of being part of national taskforce for COVID-19 financing and policy interventions. My role involved leveraging tools such as Excel, Microsoft PowerBI, and the Power Platform suite (PowerApps, PowerAutomate, and Power Virtual Agents) to develop a dataflow that significantly aided in monitoring and reporting.</li>                         
                          <br>
                          <li> I then pursue my recent masterâ€™s degree, specialising in policy analysis with focus on health economics - pertaining allocation, cost-effectiveness, evaluation and effective use of resources. I extensively used the R programming language for statistical and regression analysis and integrated my coursework with Tableau and RShiny to present my findings. In the process, I explored the use cases of artificial intelligence and machine learning in financing development and policy decisions on a global scale as part of my thesis, where I discover the need of secure, scalable, and cost-effective solutions through cloud computing technology.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li> With that being said, I am currently expanding my skill set by learning cloud solutions, specifically Azure and AWS, while dabbling with Python for its wide-ranging applications in machine learning that are prevalent in the industry.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li> As the world is moving towards generative AI and predictive analytics, it has led me to transition into data-driven journey especially in data analysis and data scientist role leveraging data ecosystem with scalalable cloud solutions.</li></p>"
